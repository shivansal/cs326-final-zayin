## Innovative Idea
Spazz is a web application that enables users to stream and view live ameatur sports. Spazz brings the game to your laptop allowing our users to never have to leave their comfort zone. With low latency streaming and interactive chat, we provide a collaborative space for sport fans to get together. Currently, there is no way for sport fans to tune into amateur sporting events and Spazz hopes to fix this problem.
